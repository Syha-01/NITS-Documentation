# Permissions

The API uses a permission-based access control system. Permissions are assigned to users and checked by middleware for protected endpoints.

## Available Permissions

- `nits:read`: Allows reading NIT sessions.
- `nits:write`: Allows creating, updating, and deleting NIT sessions.
- `officers:read`: Allows reading officer data.
- `officers:write`: Allows creating, updating, and deleting officer data.
- `courses:read`: Allows reading course data.
- `courses:write`: Allows creating, updating, and deleting course data.
- `facilitators:read`: Allows reading facilitator data.
- `facilitators:write`: Allows creating, updating, and deleting facilitator data.
- `feedback:read`: Allows reading feedback.
- `feedback:write`: Allows submitting feedback.
- `admin:all`: Super-user permission that grants access to all endpoints, including administrative ones like adding permissions to other users.
