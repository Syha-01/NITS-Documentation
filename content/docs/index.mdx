# API Reference

Welcome to the API reference for the National In-service Training program. This documentation provides detailed information about the available endpoints, data models, and error handling.

This documentation is divided into the following sections:

- [Healthcheck](./healthcheck)
- [NITs](./nits)
- [Officers](./officers)
- [Courses](./courses)
- [Facilitators](./facilitators)
- [Feedback and Ratings](./feedback)

## Base URL

The base URL for all API endpoints is:

```
http://localhost:4000/v1
```

## Authentication

Currently, the API does not require authentication. This will be implemented in a future version.

## Rate Limiting

The API has a rate limiter to prevent abuse. The default settings are a burst of 5 requests and 2 requests per second. If you exceed these limits, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request.

*   `200 OK`: The request was successful.
*   `201 Created`: The resource was successfully created.
*   `400 Bad Request`: The request was malformed or invalid.
*   `404 Not Found`: The requested resource could not be found.
*   `422 Unprocessable Entity`: The request was well-formed but could not be processed due to validation errors.
*   `429 Too Many Requests`: The rate limit has been exceeded.
*   `500 Internal Server Error`: An unexpected error occurred on the server.

When an error occurs, the response body will contain a JSON object with an `error` key that provides more information about the error. For validation errors, the `error` object will contain a map of the invalid fields and the corresponding error messages.
