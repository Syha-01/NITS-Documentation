# Rate Limiting

The API uses a rate limiter to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage. By default, the rate limiter allows 5 requests per second with a burst of 2.

## Test the rate limiter

This command will send 8 requests to the healthcheck endpoint. If the rate limiter is enabled with the default settings, the first 5 requests should succeed and the next 3 should be rejected with a `429 Too Many Requests` status.

```bash
for i in {1..8}; do curl -i localhost:4000/v1/healthcheck; done
```

## Test with the rate limiter disabled

To test with the rate limiter disabled, you need to start the server with the `-limiter-enabled=false` flag.

```bash
go run ./cmd/api -limiter-enabled=false
```

Then, run the same curl command. All 8 requests should succeed.

```bash
for i in {1..8}; do curl -i localhost:4000/v1/healthcheck; done
