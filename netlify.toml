# The following redirect is intended to fix issues where URLs without a trailing slash
# are not correctly handled by the routing mechanism. By enforcing a trailing slash,
# we ensure that all paths are treated as directories, which is the expected behavior
# for the documentation pages.

#[[redirects]]
#  from = "/docs/*"
 # to = "/docs/:splat/"
 # status = 301
  #force = true
